<p>   I changed the basemap to light grey so I could use a darker color ramp. I wanted to use a ramp from purple to blue or from green to blue but those didn't show the different categories clearly enough so I settled on a ramp that goes from yellow to blue. </p>
<p> I think that a 2d map is more appropriate if you are trying to show something on a smaller scale, such as where the atms are located, in a city or a state. Whereas a 3d globe would be more appropriate if you were trying to display the whole world with data on it, such as flight paths from continent to continent. I feel like we use 2d maps when its not absolutely necessary to use a 3d model (elevation) because its smaller data and easier to code and map. This could change as technology continues to advance and things that used to be hard to do become easier and fast to accomplish.

ps. Thanks for everything this term Bo, as nervous as I was having had no experience I learned a lot and enjoyed myself.
